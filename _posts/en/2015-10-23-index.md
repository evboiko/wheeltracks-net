    We did not raise our prices <strong>since year 2010</strong>, but we were working hard on improving
    our construction and the materials we use. In October this year our prices will be increased by <strong>10-20%</strong> depending on the model, but you will get <strong>two times better quality</strong>!

          At  the very beginning we had a dream to create a self-made cross-country vehicle from an ordinary car. 2001 was the first time the car Niva was put on the tracks by the future owners of «Wheeltracks».
          The Company has been providing its product since 2007 on the russian market.

          Cross-country vehicle on the base of Offroad devices for vehicles  of the company «Wheeltracks» shows itself perfectly not just during winter season but also in the summer time on the off-road. The ability to use tracks on passenger cars and SUVs allows to use easily an ordinary car for fishing and hunting on impenetrable terrains.

          A distinctive feature of “Wheeltracks” off-road devices is universal design which allows when having only one set of movers transform any car into a self-made tracked cross-country vehicle with high cross.

          Accordingly, off-roading is available for the passenger cars rather than only for prepared jeeps.  You’ll need just 30 minutes to transform your car into a real off-roader for hunting, fishing and other purposes relevant to you with the help of “Wheeltracks” devices for vehicles.
